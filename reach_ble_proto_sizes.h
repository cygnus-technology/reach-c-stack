/**
 * @file      reach_ble_proto_sizes.h
 * @brief     This file contains structure sizes defining reach.options for BLE 
 *            usage These sizes are based on the 240 byte BLE packetand are
 *            tuned to fit in all cases. Hence there is no need for a separate
 *            packetizing layer. These values are used to populate reach.options
 *            for nanopb. cr_stack.h uses these to define more specific buffer
 *            sizes. If you have a reason to change these, consider the effect
 *            in cr_stack.h, where you could use a different common size and
 *            reach.options.prototype and the DeviceInfoResponse message in
 *            reach.proto.
