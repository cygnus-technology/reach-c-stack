# README

This is a submodule of the reacher-mp project. 

### What is this repository for?

* This is the C language implementation of the Reach protocol stack using Protobufs.  It is designed to be included as a submodule in an application.
* In addition to the core reach functionality, it includes the services such as logging and printing JSON that are used. 
* The silabs directory includes files appropriate for a Silicon Labs EFR32/BGM solution.

### How do I get set up?

* Clone or fork the "reacher-mp" super project.
* Follow the instructions there.
